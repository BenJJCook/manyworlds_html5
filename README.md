# manyworlds_html5
A tile based website, that lets you add images to a tile grid, then select them to view them. Project for fun!

This is mostly so I have something to show for my abilities. It's also a minor test on Bootstrap 4, which is rather incomplete at this point in time,
and I honestly don't really like the changes, but oh well.

Check out a live version of the site, at http://www.benjamescook.com/manyworlds/
